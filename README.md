# Rails Homework

### Brief:

* Create a full crud resource for Posts.
* You  can only use the rails generate for model, controller and migration. No use of scaffolds
* You need to create all the forms necessary to do the crud actions on the resources. (Look at form helpers that we looked at, use the lessons we have done today as a reference)

Bonus

* Use your seed file to seed data into your database
* Style your app to look smart
* Create the Users resource

### What went well:

I managed to get all the CRUD resources working with forms that will create a new post or update one and a delete button.

### Difficulties:

I did not really understand how the forms worked and got a number of errors when creating the update and create methods which took a while to fix.

### What I delivered:

I delivered all of the main deliverables. These were creating a full crud resource for posts and only using the generate functions we were allowed as well as creating the forms to do the crud actions.
